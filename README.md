# Agents-Portal
A portal for students to find agents and apply for scholarships

## Objective
To create a portal where students can browse for scholarships based in China. The scholarships will be uploaded by individual agents and the students can contact them 
directly or through the app and apply for the scholarships.

## Purpose?
In China, the number of foreign student consultancies have increased and the chance of being scammed is very high. To find a legit consultancy,
a student has to go through a lot and spend a reasonable amount of money. This portal verifies agents based on their services and background research,
the payment method will be very secure and the students can track their scholarship applications.
